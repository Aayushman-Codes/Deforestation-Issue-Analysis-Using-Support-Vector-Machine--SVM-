# DEFORESTATION-ISSUE-ANALYSIS-USING-SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINES

**Deforestation Issue Analysis Using Support Vector Machines(SVM)**

This model was built on Kaggle Notebook since the code might not work on Jupyter Notebook due to version diferences or the use of Jupyter Web (which isnt the problem with Kaggle Notebook). The main source code utilises Machine Learning Algorithms specified to give the required output (included with the code itself).

**Original Kaggle Notebook Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/code/aayushmancodez/deforestation-issue-analysis-using-support-vector

**To run the model:**

1) Open Kaggle

2) Create a new Notebook

3) Copy and paste the source code from this project

4) Run the notebook to see the output

**Model Summary**

Type of Model: Support Vector Machine (SVR) with GridSearchCV

Objective:
This project analyzes global deforestation patterns to identify key socioeconomic and environmental factors contributing to tree cover loss. Using SVM regression with hyperparameter tuning, it quantifies relationships between GDP, population, CO2 emissions, policy strictness, and deforestation rates across countries. The model helps prioritize intervention strategies by identifying the most influential drivers of deforestation.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
